# RTALearning

A prototype tool on learning one-clock timed automata.

### Overview

This tool is dedicated to learning deterministic one-clock timed automata (DOTAs) which is a subclass of Timed automata with only one clock. In 1987, Dana Angluin introduced the $L^*$ Algorithm for learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples. The tool implement an Angluin-style active learning algorithm on DOTAs. (This branch is with a accelerating trick.)

### Installation & Usage

#### Prerequisite

- Python 3.5.* (or high)


#### Installation

- Just download.

It's a pure Python program. (We have test it on Ubuntu 16.04 64bit with Python 3.5.2)

#### Usage

For example

```shell
python3 learnota.py experiments/example.json
```

- `learnota.py` is the main file of the program.

- The target DOTA is stored in a JSON file, in this example, `a.json` . The details are as follows.

  ```json
  {
    "name": "A",
    "s": ["1", "2"],
  	"sigma": ["a", "b"],
  	"tran": {
  		"0": ["1", "a", "(1,3)", "n", "2"],
  		"1": ["1", "b", "[0,+)", "r", "2"],
  		"2": ["2", "b", "[2,4)", "r" "2"]
  	},
  	"init": "1",
  	"accept": ["2"]
  }
  ```

  - "name" : the name of the target DOTA;
  - "s" : the set of the name of locations;
  - "sigma" : the alphabet;
  - "tran" : the set of transitions in the following form:
    - transition id : [name of the source location, action, guard, reset, name of the target location]
    - '+' in a guard means $+\infty$;
    - ''r''  means reset the clock, ''n'' otherwise.

  - "init" : the name of initial location;
  - "accept" : the set of the name of accepting locations.

#### Output

- Every iteration instance of the timed observation table during the learning process;
- If we learn the target DOTA successfully, then the finial COTA will be printed on the terminal. Additionally, the total time, the size of $S$, the size of $R$, the size of $Eâ€‹$, the number of equivalence query, and the number of membership query will also be given. 
- If we did not learn the target DOTA, we print "Error! Learning Failed." on the terminal.
- The randomly experiments can be conducted by running the shell scripts in the corresponding folders. The results are stored in a folder named ''results''. In the results file,  one line for  a DOTA. The 8 numbers mean the total time, $\lvert S \rvert$, $\lvert R \rvert$, $\lvert E \rvert$ (excluding the empty word), the iteration numbers of the table, the number of membership queries, the number of equivalence queries and the number of locations in the learned DOTA, respectively.
